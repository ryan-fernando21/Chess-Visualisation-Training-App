# Chess-Visualisation-Training-App

I created this little project to help me train my visualisation skills in chess.

The user will be able to import any game from their chess platform in the standard pgn format ( For example, there is a download button at the end of a game on chess.com),
The app will then process the game and dictate the moves at a given pace, which the user can modify to make the task easier or more challenging.

The user should play the moves in real time, on a real board ( or online), and increase the training speed 
until they can no longer rely on reading the square names on the board.

The goal is for them to eventually be able to visualize a whole game in their mind.
